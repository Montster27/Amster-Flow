# HTTPS Setup for Local Development

This project is configured to run with HTTPS for local development using `mkcert`.

## Initial Setup

### 1. Install mkcert (if not already installed)

```bash
# macOS
brew install mkcert

# Linux
sudo apt install mkcert  # or equivalent for your distro

# Windows
choco install mkcert  # or download from GitHub releases
```

### 2. Install the local Certificate Authority

Run this command and enter your password when prompted:

```bash
mkcert -install
```

This installs a local certificate authority in your system's trust store, allowing your browser to trust the self-signed certificates.

### 3. Generate certificates

```bash
mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```

This creates two files:
- `localhost+2.pem` (certificate)
- `localhost+2-key.pem` (private key)

These files are already in `.gitignore` and will not be committed to version control.

## Running the Application

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at **https://localhost:3000**

## Browser Access

After running `mkcert -install`, all modern browsers will trust the certificates:

- ✅ Safari
- ✅ Chrome
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Edge

No security warnings should appear.

## Troubleshooting

### "Safari Can't Open the Page"

If you see this error, make sure you:

1. Ran `mkcert -install` (requires sudo password)
2. Generated the certificates in the project root
3. Restarted the dev server after generating certificates
4. Hard refresh Safari (Cmd + Shift + R)

### Certificate Expired

Certificates generated by mkcert are valid for 3 years. If expired, regenerate them:

```bash
mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```

Then restart the dev server.

## Production

For production deployments, use proper SSL certificates from:
- Let's Encrypt (free)
- Cloudflare
- Your hosting provider (Vercel, Netlify, etc. provide HTTPS automatically)

Do **not** use mkcert certificates in production.
