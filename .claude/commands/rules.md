Read the AI_RULES.md file in the repository root and follow all rules defined in it for this entire session. These rules define:

- Areas you must never modify (schema, auth, email)
- Areas requiring explicit permission (breaking changes, new integrations)
- Areas you can modify freely (bug fixes, new features)
- Database change protocols (migrations required)
- Testing, deployment, and error handling standards

Acknowledge that you've read and understand the rules, then ask what I'd like to work on.
